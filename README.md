# Week 1 hcallenge

## Description
This website was refactored as part of the first week challenge of the Bootcamp on FrontEnd Development by Edx & Skills for Life. 
The goal was to make this website accessibility compliant by improving the HTML Semantics, enhancing CSS by consolidating selectors and deploy everything to Github pages. 
During this project I learnt about the importance on accesibility of working on a website that follows a logical structure.
